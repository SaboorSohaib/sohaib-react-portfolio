      review: "Abdul Saboor Sohaib is an excellent software developer I met learning at Microverse. We worked on a project together and he was a great collaborator. He displayed the act of kindness and support to his partners, He proved his commitment and determination over and over again, He's the type of person that has the patience to learn new things, and his attention to detail is evident in all of the projects I've worked with him on. He is always PUNCTUAL and values your time. It has been a pleasure working with him! I recommend him highly and without reservations.",

      review: "Abdul is a developer you'll surely want on your team due to his perseverance, he stiffs to know more and is open to learning something new. He offers help whenever he can and is also a good team player. He loves professionalism and strives to get the job done, efficiently though. I recommend Abdul for any job involving a team player and efficient code writing.",

      review: "Abdul Saboor is exactly the sort of software developer any company would love. I met them while struggling with a tough data structures problem, and within a few minutes they'd managed to explain a concept I'd been struggling with for days. They have a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, and as a junior developer, that was really valuable for me. They're also just a fun person to chat with! If you need to get a job done simply and efficiently, Abdul Saboor is definitely the person for you.",

      review: "Abdul Saboor Sohaib is a fantastic software engineer, and his detail-oriented approach made him a pleasure to work with. We pair-programmed extensively together while enrolled in a software development program, and at that time his work ethic blew me away. Abdul Saboor Sohaib views writing clean, accessible code as a calling, and he's great at identifying areas where we can improve UI. He's also super friendly; by the time our project was done, I felt like we'd known each other for years. I can't recommend him enough!",
